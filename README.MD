Replicated Udemy's Complete Android 12 & Kotlin Development Masterclass Quiz App. While following the base for the UI design as well as requirements, 
I fully implemented my own algorithms, used ConstraintLayout rather than LinearLayout, as well as made usage of data binding. Additionally, 
I added an additional activity, WrongAnswersActivity, to allow the user at the end of the quiz to view the correct answer(s) for the question(s) 
they answered incorrectly.
